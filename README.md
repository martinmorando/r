# R

## Quick Overview
- Created in 1993, it's free and open-source
- Thousands of free packages available
- Widely used for statistical analysis, data manipulation and data visualization


## Running R Code
There are at least 2 ways:
- **R Script Files (.r)**: `Rscript file.r`
- **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)**: run code cells individually


## Data Sources & Credits
